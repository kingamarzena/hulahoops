        Hula hoopers belong to juggling and fire dancing communities all over the World. Your chance to meet a local hooper is by attending hula hoop classes in your local area. In Aberdeen you will find them in "Inverted" - professional and "The University of Aberdeen Circus Society". If you want to extend your relationships to a european level, EJC, European Juggling Convention is something you must be a part of! The annual festival which gained international fame will become your new home! Or maybe you can never have enough friends and want get inspired by amazing stories of other hula hoopers? Register on hulahooping.org then. It was the first site connecting hoopers and it still works perfectly, organizing competitions, posting clips of less and more professional hula hoopers, it also enables you to buy the hula hoop of your dream. All in the name of having a good time (and earning money XD).
