      <h1>Ancient times</h1>
      It is still a mystery when or where a circle became a form of exercise. We do know that Egyptian children played with hoops and the ancient Greeks used hoops to exercise. A vase in the Louvre [dated 500-490 BCE] shows Ganymede rolling a hoop. Unfortunately, we don't know if hooping was part of the early Olympics.

    <p> <h2>Great Britain in 14th century</h2>
      Hoops were popular in Great Britain in the 14th century as a form of recreation. Medical records from doctors shown that treating dislocated backs and heart attacks were attributed to hooping. The term “hula hoop” came from British sailors who had seen hula dancing in the Hawaiian Islands and thought humps movements looked similar to the ones of hooping. Hooping was again popular in England in the 1800 where children would roll hoops with a stick or spin the hoop around their waist. <br />

    <p><h3>1950s craze</h3>
      The hula hoop craze of the late 50’s can be traced back to Australia, where children twirled hoops made out of bamboo. When the production of bamboo hoops could not meet the demand, Toltoys was engaged to make hoops out of plastic and sold 400,000 hoops in 1957. Hula Hoops from the 50's were small colorful plastic tubes made primarily for children to play and exercise. Today, hula hooping has form of full circle. Children still love them and adults have begun using stronger, larger, heavier hoops for fitness and fun. Nowadays, circus acts involving hula hooping became quite popular due to Cirque du Soleil usage of this equiplemnt.
